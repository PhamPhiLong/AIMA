This is a porting version of Norvig and Russell's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" library initially written in Java by Ravi Mohan

Folder hierarchy:
   - core: contains the porting code of the AIMA core library. All the codes strictly follow the design of the original Java version.
   - utility: contains the supported code that isn't implemented by the C standard library, for instance: abstract data type, etc.
